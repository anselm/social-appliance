# Privacy, grey space etc

- we'll have to work hard on a well defined privacy policy, and define this in code, as well as legal obligations

- small groups tend to have trust, but clearly they're not going to want to put their stuff on a big network

- we're going to also want to discourage truly private content; we really want to find a safe way for people to share things that can be public, but also providing some local knowledge

- one thing that can be hard to do in new places is avoiding people trying to sell you stuff; it would be nice to avoid some of the excesses here - can make visiting new places unpleasant
