## Regression tests

[TBD]

Note are not worrying about authentication in this stage, there will be a sophisticated cryptographic authentication system later. For this stage we just verify the following:

Create a user account (users are just entities of type 'party')
Create a group with a slug
Create a post (in a group) - posts may have autogenerated slugs
Create a second post with the same slug - this should fail!
Create a post at a location
Create a post that is a child of another post
Query for posts near a location with pagination and offset
Query for posts not near location -> should return no results
Delete the test data
