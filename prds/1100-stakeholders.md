# Stakeholders

## Identifying participants

- we often have trouble seeing what we don't know, it can be hard to see stakeholders
- obvious stakeholders include contributors and users that we anticipate using the product
- other stakeholders could be people we don't see clearly, or even forests, or non human entities

## Challenges today in participation

- stakeholders are being occluded from seeing each other clearly

	- hard to communicate at the best of times
	- ideas like fundamental human rights are not well instilled as values
	- systems we're inside of are incentivized to have us compete against each other
	- there are real and pressing large scale issues that can make it hard to think clearly
	- we physically live in landscapes that make it hard to have person to person communication
	- it is hard to scale communication in general

	- also larger social media websites are at odds with what is best for their users
	- not incentivized to remove egregiously fake actors, fake media
	- not incentivized to encourage rational sober or charitable discourse in general
	- no way to cleary downscore or mark up bad actors, community notes on x is too laborious

## Groups versus individuals

- in the west we tend to focus on individuals, but groups could be better catered to as well
- what can we do to foster groupware?
- being more group centric
- helping showcase participants in groups; reward group participation in some way?
- continue to research

## A compact with users

- privacy
- open data, open source, community owned
- right to be forgotten

## Expectations on User responsibilities

- charitable
- best behavior
- filter bad actors

## Compact with other developers and contributors

- open source
- open data
- open api
- open participation

## Later mechanics?

- delegating voting (dao)?
- revenue distributed by dao?
- attach to public ledgers if group admins so desire; allow data to be distributed / aggregated optionally
